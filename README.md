## Small Website
I created a small website as part of an assignment.
## Description
- This website is basically a demo of how websites are designed.
- I used HTML and CSS to build this website.
- There are many challenges while making this website. I used anchor tags to navigate between pages. I used CSS styles to understand how it works.
- I would like to redesign the pages and CSS of the website to make it better.
